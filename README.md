# Additive partitioning of multi-species distributional aggregation with empirical applications

## Partitioning framework

Here, we provide a self-explained R code (Alternative additive partitioning frameworks of distributional aggregation.Rï¼‰for caculating the data dispersion (represented by a Poisson index of dispersion *I*) and spatial proximity (represented by an index as the average of pairwise Euclidean distances *P*) presented in our manuscript.
